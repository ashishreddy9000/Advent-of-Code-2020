P.S. For anyone who's wondering where's my code for Day-4 Part-2.......... I legit have no idea how to say this lol. My code reached OVER 150 lines. I was worried about the length and googled for others' solutions and found that they were below 50 lines. When comparing them, I realized how bad my code really was. It did give me the right answer on the bright side. If you're seeing this, that means that I still haven't made the code shorter. It's not really on my list of priorities rn but, I'll upload it..... eventually
